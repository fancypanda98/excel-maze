The two scripts, mazeMaker and mazeSolver, create and solve mazes made in excel.

Excel will not let external programs change the contents of a file while it is open, so you will have to the file before you run either script.

Once a maze is generated, start and end location can be changed within the excel file so that mazeSolver will follow any path you give it.
